## ✨ How to use it

Being a full-stack product, the backend and the frontend should be compiled and started separately. 
Before starting to compile the product, make sure you have the following tools installed in the environment:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) - version `14.x` or higher
- [GIT](https://git-scm.com/) - used to clone the sources from Github
- [Python3](https://www.python.org/) - used in many tools

<br />

### 👉 Start the Frontend

> **Step 1** - Once the project is downloaded, change the directory to `react-ui`.

```bash
$ cd react-ui
